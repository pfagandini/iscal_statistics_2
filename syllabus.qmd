## General Objective

The objective of this course unit is to present several statistical techniques of great practical use in management. Within the context of random phenomena, students will identify and apply probabilistic models and use the notions of statistical inference to make decisions under uncertainty.

---

## Competencies

Students are expected to acquire and reinforce fundamental concepts of Probability and Statistics. They should become proficient in the main techniques of statistical inference, supported by probability theory, with the primary goal of applying appropriate statistical methods and models to obtain conclusions that support decision-making in business contexts.

---

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

- Infer characteristics of a population from a sample, applying point and interval estimation techniques;
- Understand the general procedures for applying parametric hypothesis tests;
- Understand the specification and underlying assumptions of the linear regression model for cross-sectional data;
- Develop competencies for the joint application of various statistical techniques, using basic software that implements the studied procedures, in order to obtain results that support decision-making under uncertainty.

**3.2.** The concept of *p*-value.

**3.3.** Tests involving parameters of Normal populations: tests for means and variances.

**3.4.** Tests for the difference between means of two Normal populations.

**3.5.** Tests under asymptotic normality conditions (large samples).

---

### 4. The Linear Regression Model

**4.2.** Classical Linear Regression Model for Cross-Sectional Data.

**4.3.** OLS Estimation Method. Coefficient estimates and their interpretation.

**4.4.** Properties of the OLS estimators of regression coefficients.

**4.5.** Goodness of fit: Coefficient of determination and correlation coefficient.

**4.6.** Statistical Inference: Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals (one parameter).

**4.7.** Validation of the Classical Linear Regression Model Assumptions (Brief Overview).

---

## Assessment

Assessment may take place under a continuous assessment regime or by final exam.

### Continuous Assessment

::: {.assessment-table}

| Assessment Element | Weight | Duration | Syllabus Content | Indicative Date |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--|:--|
| Written Test 1 | 45% | 1h 20m | Topics 1 + 2.1 | Week of 23–27 March |
| Written Test 2 | 55% | 1h 20m | Topics 2.2 + 3 + 4 | Week of 18–23 May |

:::

- Continuous assessment is based on **two (2) written tests**, held in person.
- For approval under this regime, students must obtain a minimum grade of **7 (seven) points** in each assessment element. Attendance at all assessment moments is compulsory.
- The final grade is the weighted average of the two tests:

$$\text{Final Grade (CA)} = 0.45\,(\text{Test 1}) + 0.55\,(\text{Test 2})$$

- Students under continuous assessment may be subject to an oral examination whenever the instructor deems it necessary to validate the assigned grade.
- No additional minimum attendance requirements are defined beyond mandatory presence at assessment moments.

### Final Exam Regime

Students who prefer the final exam regime may sit a comprehensive exam worth **100%** of the final grade, covering all course content.
